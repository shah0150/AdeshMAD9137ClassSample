📝 Title: Clean Architecture for SwiftUI

🌟 SwiftUI's Impact:

* SwiftUI is a significant shift from UIKit.
* It's declarative and state-driven.
* Replaces callback techniques with closures and bindings.

🏗️ MVVM in SwiftUI:

* SwiftUI integrates MVVM.
* @State variables can act as ViewModels.
* More complex scenarios involve external ObservableObjects as ViewModels.

🚫 No More ViewControllers:

* ViewControllers are no longer needed in SwiftUI.

🧩 Key Components of MVVM:

* Model: Data container
* View: SwiftUI view
* ViewModel: ObservableObject encapsulating business logic

🔨 Architectural Choices:

* Clean Architecture separates the app into layers.
* Layers include Presentation, Business Logic, and Data Access.

🧬 AppState in Clean Architecture:

* AppState is an ObservableObject.
* Serves as a single source of truth for the entire app.
* Stores user data, navigation state, and system state.

🖼️ SwiftUI Views:

* SwiftUI views are usual SwiftUI views.
* Receive AppState and Interactor through dependency injection.
* Trigger side effects based on user actions or view lifecycle events.

🧾 Interactors:

* Encapsulate business logic.
* Stateless and independent of presentation and external resources.
* Communicate with AppState or a View's Binding.

📦 Repository:

* An abstract gateway for reading/writing data.
* Stateless and knows nothing about View or Interactor.
* Hides behind a protocol for testability.

🚀 Conclusion:

* Clean Architecture in SwiftUI improves testability and structure.
* Promotes a well-organized, modular app design.
