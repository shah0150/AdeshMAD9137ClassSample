The Observable Object protocol in Swift is a fundamental part of the SwiftUI framework, which is used for building user interfaces in a declarative manner. The Observable Object protocol is used to create objects that can be observed for changes in their data, and when the data changes, the SwiftUI views that depend on that data are automatically updated.

Here's how you can use the Observable Object protocol in Swift:

Define a class that conforms to the ObservableObject protocol. This class will hold the data that you want to observe for changes.

```swift
import SwiftUI

class MyModel: ObservableObject {
    @Published var data: String = "Initial Data"
}
```
In the example above, the `@Published` property wrapper is used to indicate that changes to the data property should trigger updates to the views that depend on it.

Create an instance of the class in your SwiftUI view and use it to display or manipulate the data. 

```swift
import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    @ObservedObject var model = MyModel()

    var body: some View {
        Text(model.data)
        Button("Change Data") {
            model.data = "New Data"
        }
    }
}
```
In this code, the `@ObservedObject` property wrapper is used to create a binding between the `ContentView` view and the `MyModel` object. When the data in `MyModel` changes, the view will automatically be updated.

SwiftUI will take care of updating the view whenever the data in the `MyModel` instance changes. You don't need to manually trigger view updates.

The Observable Object protocol is a key part of the SwiftUI framework and enables reactive programming in your UI code. It allows you to create dynamic and responsive user interfaces that automatically update when the underlying data changes.
